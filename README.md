This Campaign was run for our client GetSetHome.
GetSetHome is a service, a platform and an access to good quality shared accommodations and guesthouses.Â 
Through its platform, GetSetHome aims to revolutionize the process of gaining access to quality
shared & managed rental accommodations for long term stays.
GetSetHome is a multi-sided platform that serves two independent 
customer segments: the seekers (education/business/family migrators) and the owners (residential asset owners).


Key Aspects of our project for GetSetHome:
1. Increasing the Traffic on the website and the CTR through paid keywords
2. Increasing product awareness and measure which aspect of the business is highly searched for on Google
3. Brand Awareness by promoting the Facebook page and getting more likes
